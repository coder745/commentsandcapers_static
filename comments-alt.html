			<p>Just when you begin to think nothing can surprise you and your life is normal, think again because life is full of surprises.  I had two of them in one day‚Ä¶Surprise Birthday parties.    It took some doing and I am so honored that they did this for me.  I was totally and completely taken off guard.  It was a fantastic secret plan and cover up and they did a great job with both of them.    It was the best birthday I have had in many years.  I have now entered my 9th decade.  Wow!   I give my very special thanks to all those who made my entry into it, so extra special.  </p>
<p>This one is a switch.  Can you believe anyone would take a trip in order to see if they are able to take a trip?  My friends, the group that took a cruise to Alaska a few years ago, had been getting ‚ÄúCruise fever‚Äù and we all thought it would be fun to make a return trip because we had enjoyed it so much. I knew I could not go on another one because there is way too much walking. However, in answer to my ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go again‚Äù, I kept hearing ‚ÄúYes you can‚Äù.    So, I decided to check out whether it was a wise idea.   I went with A group of women from our church on a weekend retreat just to test my traveling endurance.   I have heard that one has to keep moving to keep from getting, as old folks used to say, ‚ÄúAll stoved up‚Äù. I have heard that when you quit moving, you will get to the place where you are unable to function.  I really would love to go on another cruise because the first one was fabulous‚Ä¶so I went on this trip to see if I could go on a much longer trip. </p>
<p> It was fun and I really enjoyed it.  Getting to know the ladies better and to meet some new people was really nice.  It was a beautiful conference ground, and we all had a great time.   I did have help and a wheel chair and a good friend that kept me rolling on the long walk from our room to the lunch room and meeting area.   It was a really enjoyable time of Christian fellowship.  I came home bone tired but happy.  Found out that for me, right now, the answer to the new cruise idea is ‚ÄúNo I can‚Äôt‚Äù!  However, I would recommend both experiences to you younger folks.  Both were unforgettable experiences and ‚ÄúYes you can‚Äù.  Unless, for some reason you really can‚Äôt. üôÇ </p>
<p>Ever feel like you have just too much to do. You seem busier than you really are‚Ä¶kidding yourself that you can keep up with the others and wondering why they are doing so many things while you seem to accomplish very little!  There is nothing wrong with that.  The truth is that you get tired a whole lot easier when you are at the age of thinking, ‚ÄúI remember when things were different‚Äù and seemed so much easier but life changes and getting tired easily slips up on us.  Then we find that the most important part of your day is (I love this part) eating a good lunch and then Yaa!!! It‚Äôs NAP time!!!  Just enjoy life!!  Whew, is it lunch time yet?</p>
<p>We had some very bad weather this week.   It was really bad one night and I was afraid that I would have to make a run for it which is not possible.  I can‚Äôt even walk fast but anyway, I slept in my clothes just in case.   I don‚Äôt know what the point was but it is funny how you feel safer getting blown away with your clothes on than in flimsy pajamas.  One time before in a storm I tried to run up the hill using my walker which was not working too well.  We had planned to drive but there was a tree down across the driveway so we made a slow run for it.  The wind was blowing and the rain was pelting and I was making no headway at all.  Even wheels on a walker don‚Äôt help when going uphill on wet grass.  Thankfully God sent help and we survived.  This time I did not have to run for it.  It would be good if there were such a thing as a motorized walker but unfortunately it hasn‚Äôt been invented yet.  </p>
<p>Here are a couple of short Bible questions for this time but they are all really just one.    When Israel first came into the Promised Land, each tribe had to fight for their allotted portion by driving out their enemies, who occupied the land.  The tribe of Judah had a special order from God to go up first and fight against the Canaanites.  What kind of a deal did Judah make with his brother Simeon?  How were thumbs and big toes involved in this fight?  Why?  This one is easy.  Let‚Äôs see who gets it first this time.  </p>
<p>Someone sent me this wish and I thought it was very interesting:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay this May be unbelievably exceptional, amazingly colorful and filled with joy, laughter and love.‚Äù  And I might add, keep your eyes on the eastern sky‚Ä¶</p>
<p>God Bless you all.<br />
Love,<br />
Carolyn</p>

Hi,<br />
It is a brand new year and times are changing.  Every day there seems to be new problems and very few solutions.  Our country is in need of much prayer and an old fashioned revival.   </p>
<p>I am still trying to stay active and we are planning another trip soon.  This will be a bus tour to the southern east coast and promises to be a fun trip.  I hope I am up to it.   We had such a good time on the last trip.  There is nothing like a get away with a group of other Christians, especially this group of Traveling OWLS‚Äù.  That is the name of the group‚Ä¶Older, Wiser, Livelier, Seniors.  I may not be the liveliest one of the bunch but I will be doing my best to keep up.  </p>
<p> I am expecting a visit from my daughter and family from another state sometime in the spring.  It has been over a year since I have seen them and that is far too long.   I am glad my daughter is a good cook because; I will need some help.  My slogan, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt Microwave it forget it‚Äù will have to be put on hold for awhile.   That doesn‚Äôt work for a crowd.  My stove won‚Äôt know what is happening.   </p>
<p>God is good.  He gives us smiles even when things are a little crazy.  I had an amusing experience at church a couple Sundays ago.  It made me smile but it really wasn‚Äôt funny at all.   I was listening to the Choir and suddenly all of them had on clothes that were white, with red and green dots all over them.  The preacher had them all over his suit also.  It was so strange.  Then I looked at a lady a couple rows ahead of me and her hair was filled with beautiful little red white and green candy canes.  I thought it was quite amusing at first but when my vision stayed that way until the next day I decided I needed to see about it.  </p>
<p>So it was off to the eye clinic and a through examination.  What a way to celebrate New Years Eve.  Although fire works couldn‚Äôt have been much prettier than that color show, I needed a reason for it.   I had been having ocular migraine headaches every day all week and the doctor thought they may have caused the color show.  Well, the doctors couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong except for age related Macular Degeneration.  Isn‚Äôt it fun to go to see doctors for help and they let you know your problem is that you are just getting old.  Well, I already knew that!!!</p>
<p>My life has taken on some other changes too It seems I am going to the Doctor every other day lately.  Remember last month I had that trip to emergency with a rapid heart beat?  At that time they did an x-ray and an MRI.   They found a spot on my lung and thought I might have pneumonia.  I have been coughing a lot lately and yet have had no cold.    I went to the hospital last week for a lung biopsy to see what the problem was and when the report came back yesterday it was serious.  I think the cough was trying to tell me something was wrong.   Imagine the shock when I heard the word no one ever wants to hear, Cancer. That was a real shocker.   I didn‚Äôt get much sleep that night.  There is nothing quite like a little glitch in the daily routine to set you back on your heels and get your brain to whirling.</p>
<p>The next morning, as I was in the shower in the comfort of the warm water washing over me, my mind was in a daze. If only this problem was all a dream and I could wake up and it would all go away,   I often sing in the shower-even though I can‚Äôt carry a tune but no one cares about people singing in the rain or the shower.  This time I wasn‚Äôt singing I was praying.  </p>
<p>Funny, I didn‚Äôt pray for healing at that moment, I prayed for the warmth of God‚Äôs grace and mercy to wash over me just like the warmth of the water.  I have no idea why I prayed that way.  I suddenly felt an inner peace and the assurance of God‚Äôs promise which says, ‚ÄúMy Grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in your weakness‚Äù.  Nothing happens in our lives without His knowledge.  He cares about every part of our lives.  He has said in his Word, ‚ÄúI will never leave you nor forsake you.  </p>
<p>It is easy to thank God when things are going well but what about times like these.  Am I to thank God for this?  Yes.  I admit it is not easy.  Once again I am reminded of Romans 8:28-29.  All things- notice that ALL.  Verse 29 says that he is still working on me.  I still have a lot to learn.  </p>
<p>Jesus conversation with Peter in Luke 22:31 and 32 is very interesting.  Peter was about to face trials and attacks by Satan that would greatly test his faith.  Jesus said, ‚ÄúI have prayed for you that your ‚Äúfaith fail not‚Äù.  (The ‚Äòyou‚Äô here is plural, so it included all the disciples, as well as you and me).   Just as with Peter, when we have trials we can take courage because Jesus prayed for us a long time ago, that our ‚Äúfaith fail not‚Äù.   What a comforting thought.</p>
<p>My faith and trust is in Him.  I don‚Äôt know what the future holds but I know who holds the future.  It‚Äôs a secret known only to God‚Äù.  He knows the outcome and I want his will in my life.  I would appreciate your prayers for me.</p>
<p>Here is a question for this month. What does the Bible say about the value of the ‚Äútrial of our faith‚Äù?</p>
<p>Have a wonderful 2013 and thank you for your prayers.  God is Faithful. </p>
<p>Hugs,<br />
Carolyn </p>
