								<h2>Allow me to introduce myself&#8230;</h2>

								<p>I was born at a time when comments from children were not readily accepted and capers were strictly controlled. I was raised in a <a href="images/caroly_young2.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="caroly_young" src="images/caroly_young2.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>family where the rule was that father knows best and Mom was the home maker.</p>
<p>It was a &#8220;Walton&#8217;s&#8221; type existence where children were many and money was scarce. Roosevelt was president and the WPA was a source of employment. Times were tough but neighbors helped each and we survived.</p>
<p>Today it is fun to make comments about the past with all its restrictions and the  						Capers we as children loved to try to get away with.  There were many blessings too.  						We always had food to eat and a roof over our heads. We were taken to church with  						our parents, not just sent there. It was not easy because we had no car and the  						only way there was by bus and transfer to a street car. However they always went  						each carrying one child and holding the hand of another. I wonder if that would  						work in this day and time.</p>
<p>We lived in a free country with no fear of whether what we did was politically  						correct. The Bible was the absolute truth (and still is) to live by. We were taught  						right from wrong and that breaking the rules has its consequence. There were no  						frivolous law suits in my memory. We learned that accidents happen and how to roll  						with the punches and to be responsible for what we did and not to blame others for  						our problems. Life was good in spite of the hardships. We were all in it together.  						As to our childhood type Capers, well, I will save that for another page.</p>
<p>I was introduced to Jesus Christ at an early age. He became my Savior at the age of  						six and has never left me. My life now is one of completion with my own wonderful  						family of two children, five grandchildren and a host of super friends. I am blessed 						also with a church family that I love and the opportunity of teaching Sunday school  						to a precious group of ladies. Now that I am in the winter and of my life as a senior  						citizen, I can look at my past and my present experiences and know that I have been  						blessed with the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>My very special grandson has made this website for me and I hope to use it for the  						Glory of the Lord. I have been given this opportunity of sharing my blessings with  						you. It is my desire to be an encourager to others through these pages with  						comments of my own experience as well as making us all more aware of the Greatness  						of our Awesome God.</p>
