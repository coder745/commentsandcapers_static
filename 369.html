						<h2>This and That for April and May 2014</h2>

					<p>Just when you begin to think nothing can surprise you and your life is normal, think again because life is full of surprises.  I had two of them in one day‚Ä¶Surprise Birthday parties.    It took some doing and I am so honored that they did this for me.  I was totally and completely taken off guard.  It was a fantastic secret plan and cover up and they did a great job with both of them.    It was the best birthday I have had in many years.  I have now entered my 9th decade.  Wow!   I give my very special thanks to all those who made my entry into it, so extra special.  </p>
<p>This one is a switch.  Can you believe anyone would take a trip in order to see if they are able to take a trip?  My friends, the group that took a cruise to Alaska a few years ago, had been getting ‚ÄúCruise fever‚Äù and we all thought it would be fun to make a return trip because we had enjoyed it so much. I knew I could not go on another one because there is way too much walking. However, in answer to my ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go again‚Äù, I kept hearing ‚ÄúYes you can‚Äù.    So, I decided to check out whether it was a wise idea.   I went with A group of women from our church on a weekend retreat just to test my traveling endurance.   I have heard that one has to keep moving to keep from getting, as old folks used to say, ‚ÄúAll stoved up‚Äù. I have heard that when you quit moving, you will get to the place where you are unable to function.  I really would love to go on another cruise because the first one was fabulous‚Ä¶so I went on this trip to see if I could go on a much longer trip. </p>
<p> It was fun and I really enjoyed it.  Getting to know the ladies better and to meet some new people was really nice.  It was a beautiful conference ground, and we all had a great time.   I did have help and a wheel chair and a good friend that kept me rolling on the long walk from our room to the lunch room and meeting area.   It was a really enjoyable time of Christian fellowship.  I came home bone tired but happy.  Found out that for me, right now, the answer to the new cruise idea is ‚ÄúNo I can‚Äôt‚Äù!  However, I would recommend both experiences to you younger folks.  Both were unforgettable experiences and ‚ÄúYes you can‚Äù.  Unless, for some reason you really can‚Äôt. üôÇ </p>
<p>Ever feel like you have just too much to do. You seem busier than you really are‚Ä¶kidding yourself that you can keep up with the others and wondering why they are doing so many things while you seem to accomplish very little!  There is nothing wrong with that.  The truth is that you get tired a whole lot easier when you are at the age of thinking, ‚ÄúI remember when things were different‚Äù and seemed so much easier but life changes and getting tired easily slips up on us.  Then we find that the most important part of your day is (I love this part) eating a good lunch and then Yaa!!! It‚Äôs NAP time!!!  Just enjoy life!!  Whew, is it lunch time yet?</p>
<p>We had some very bad weather this week.   It was really bad one night and I was afraid that I would have to make a run for it which is not possible.  I can‚Äôt even walk fast but anyway, I slept in my clothes just in case.   I don‚Äôt know what the point was but it is funny how you feel safer getting blown away with your clothes on than in flimsy pajamas.  One time before in a storm I tried to run up the hill using my walker which was not working too well.  We had planned to drive but there was a tree down across the driveway so we made a slow run for it.  The wind was blowing and the rain was pelting and I was making no headway at all.  Even wheels on a walker don‚Äôt help when going uphill on wet grass.  Thankfully God sent help and we survived.  This time I did not have to run for it.  It would be good if there were such a thing as a motorized walker but unfortunately it hasn‚Äôt been invented yet.  </p>
<p>Here are a couple of short Bible questions for this time but they are all really just one.    When Israel first came into the Promised Land, each tribe had to fight for their allotted portion by driving out their enemies, who occupied the land.  The tribe of Judah had a special order from God to go up first and fight against the Canaanites.  What kind of a deal did Judah make with his brother Simeon?  How were thumbs and big toes involved in this fight?  Why?  This one is easy.  Let‚Äôs see who gets it first this time.  </p>
<p>Someone sent me this wish and I thought it was very interesting:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay this May be unbelievably exceptional, amazingly colorful and filled with joy, laughter and love.‚Äù  And I might add, keep your eyes on the eastern sky‚Ä¶</p>
<p>God Bless you all.<br />
Love,<br />
Carolyn</p>
