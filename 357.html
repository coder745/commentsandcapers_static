						<h2>Chats with Carolyn</h2>

					<p>January 2013<br />
Hi,<br />
It is a brand new year and times are changing.  Every day there seems to be new problems and very few solutions.  Our country is in need of much prayer and an old fashioned revival.   </p>
<p>I am still trying to stay active and we are planning another trip soon.  This will be a bus tour to the southern east coast and promises to be a fun trip.  I hope I am up to it.   We had such a good time on the last trip.  There is nothing like a get away with a group of other Christians, especially this group of Traveling OWLS”.  That is the name of the group…Older, Wiser, Livelier, Seniors.  I may not be the liveliest one of the bunch but I will be doing my best to keep up.  </p>
<p> I am expecting a visit from my daughter and family from another state sometime in the spring.  It has been over a year since I have seen them and that is far too long.   I am glad my daughter is a good cook because; I will need some help.  My slogan, “If you can’t Microwave it forget it” will have to be put on hold for awhile.   That doesn’t work for a crowd.  My stove won’t know what is happening.   </p>
<p>God is good.  He gives us smiles even when things are a little crazy.  I had an amusing experience at church a couple Sundays ago.  It made me smile but it really wasn’t funny at all.   I was listening to the Choir and suddenly all of them had on clothes that were white, with red and green dots all over them.  The preacher had them all over his suit also.  It was so strange.  Then I looked at a lady a couple rows ahead of me and her hair was filled with beautiful little red white and green candy canes.  I thought it was quite amusing at first but when my vision stayed that way until the next day I decided I needed to see about it.  </p>
<p>So it was off to the eye clinic and a through examination.  What a way to celebrate New Years Eve.  Although fire works couldn’t have been much prettier than that color show, I needed a reason for it.   I had been having ocular migraine headaches every day all week and the doctor thought they may have caused the color show.  Well, the doctors couldn’t find anything wrong except for age related Macular Degeneration.  Isn’t it fun to go to see doctors for help and they let you know your problem is that you are just getting old.  Well, I already knew that!!!</p>
<p>My life has taken on some other changes too It seems I am going to the Doctor every other day lately.  Remember last month I had that trip to emergency with a rapid heart beat?  At that time they did an x-ray and an MRI.   They found a spot on my lung and thought I might have pneumonia.  I have been coughing a lot lately and yet have had no cold.    I went to the hospital last week for a lung biopsy to see what the problem was and when the report came back yesterday it was serious.  I think the cough was trying to tell me something was wrong.   Imagine the shock when I heard the word no one ever wants to hear, Cancer. That was a real shocker.   I didn’t get much sleep that night.  There is nothing quite like a little glitch in the daily routine to set you back on your heels and get your brain to whirling.</p>
<p>The next morning, as I was in the shower in the comfort of the warm water washing over me, my mind was in a daze. If only this problem was all a dream and I could wake up and it would all go away,   I often sing in the shower-even though I can’t carry a tune but no one cares about people singing in the rain or the shower.  This time I wasn’t singing I was praying.  </p>
<p>Funny, I didn’t pray for healing at that moment, I prayed for the warmth of God’s grace and mercy to wash over me just like the warmth of the water.  I have no idea why I prayed that way.  I suddenly felt an inner peace and the assurance of God’s promise which says, “My Grace is sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in your weakness”.  Nothing happens in our lives without His knowledge.  He cares about every part of our lives.  He has said in his Word, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.  </p>
<p>It is easy to thank God when things are going well but what about times like these.  Am I to thank God for this?  Yes.  I admit it is not easy.  Once again I am reminded of Romans 8:28-29.  All things- notice that ALL.  Verse 29 says that he is still working on me.  I still have a lot to learn.  </p>
<p>Jesus conversation with Peter in Luke 22:31 and 32 is very interesting.  Peter was about to face trials and attacks by Satan that would greatly test his faith.  Jesus said, “I have prayed for you that your “faith fail not”.  (The ‘you’ here is plural, so it included all the disciples, as well as you and me).   Just as with Peter, when we have trials we can take courage because Jesus prayed for us a long time ago, that our “faith fail not”.   What a comforting thought.</p>
<p>My faith and trust is in Him.  I don’t know what the future holds but I know who holds the future.  It’s a secret known only to God”.  He knows the outcome and I want his will in my life.  I would appreciate your prayers for me.</p>
<p>Here is a question for this month. What does the Bible say about the value of the “trial of our faith”?</p>
<p>Have a wonderful 2013 and thank you for your prayers.  God is Faithful. </p>
<p>Hugs,<br />
Carolyn </p>
