I\\\'m grateful to know that you are doing better, and trust that God will sustain you as you look forward to your January visit with the doctors.

I also appreciate your encourging words regarding the tragic events there in Sandy Hook.  I can\\\'t imagine the heartache for each of those families, especially at this time of year.  I pray God will be able to use this to bring others into the fold, and that they would all be reunited with there loved ones for an eternity without evil, and with the continued presence of their Savior.

God bless you with a wonderful and Merry Christmas, and a richely blessed New Year!

God sent an angel to Balaam but only his donkey could see it at first.  Once the donkey spoke, Balaam saw it too!  (God gets our attention any way He can!)This was a recent SS lesson for my K/1st graders!

Bless you my dear friend - glad to hear your cruise was a delight! I appreciated your \'history lesson about Israel - The study of Isaiah is a real eye-opener!

I worry that so many people are blind to the deception of Obama. He is the most dangerous man to ever sit in the White House. I dont understand how a Christian could even consider voting for him.
Well...I would like to get to Alabama for the Holidays. I sure miss you, Chris etc! I might jump in the truck and drive....</p><span class='guest-user'>JOYCE  --  <span class='guest-time'>09/28/2012</span></span><p class='guest-content'>  HI CAROLYN,

I can almost feel how desperate they were and how joyous they were when God answered their prayers though this person.  God bless him and God bless you for sharing this story to us.  God bless the OWLS as well.  What a wonderful group of folks.  Have fun.

Enjoy reading of your trips.  Would love to put on the old travelling shoes and visit more of God's wonderful world.  I can't complain tho' as I have made six trips to Israel.  I would love to go again, but don't think it is in God's will.  I am praying for all of you there in the States that somehow God will give you a Godly man in November.  I don't know that much about it all, so don't know if there is such a man running for election.  As I read and reread the Bible I feel that God is preparing us for His coming, to take us home to Him.  Bad thinks just seem to escalate, so &quot;in all things I will give thanks&quot;  Once again thanks, from your sister in Christ who is about six months older than you.</p><span class='guest-user'>Sal  --  <span class='guest-time'>05/25/2012</span></span><p class='guest-content'>Especially enjoyed todays chat, reading of the generosity of the man helping the couple who were in need and hearing about your adventures.

So glad you were able to be with your family through the holidays, and that you were able to return home without problems.  It is peaceful above the clouds, isn't it?  My husband and I flew to Denver a few months ago, and I'd love to go back soon.
But today...  less than an inch of snow and they canceled Bible Study for the girls, which begins at 7...the clock is just now chiming 7!  Found out the water wasn't working, for the 3rd time in a month, and then the announcement that public school was canceled!  Well, I guess there is a reason for all things.  We're going to stay in and stay warm.  Thank the Lord for small favors...and LARGE ones!  Oh, and the water is back on, just need to get those contact points cleaned soon!
Have a wonderful day!

You always have so much good to say.  I'm sorry to hear of the pain you have and are experiencing.  It is no fun...I know.  I have 3 bulging disks and my husband seems to have 4 (bad MRI images).  I truly am thankful I can walk - again!  If not for our beautiful dog, I'd still be in my wheelchair outside the home.  No more!  I'm thankful I can still see enough that when I zoom into things on my computer, I can read!  I am thankful for the many novels I have written over the years, and that they are now all published.  I am now enjoying writing children's books, like My Very Own Christmas Book - an Advent Coloring Book for preschoolers to be able to count down to The Big Day (And It's All About Jesus' Birth!)  http://jancarolromancenovels.weebly.com</p><span class='guest-user'>Sal  --  <span class='guest-time'>11/22/2011</span></span><p class='guest-content'>Lovely entry as always my friend.

Greetings from India.

We are so happy to see this beautiful site. We appreciate your passion for the Lord and would encourage you by saying that your reward will be grate from the Lord for everything that you do for Him and His people.

We suggest you to think of starting a website for the children where you can write short stories based on bible, quizzes, puzzles etc. for children. Why we said, because you have vision to teach children about the word of God. And after making the site, you can inform about the same in your church and also to your prayer partners and prayer groups via email.

We love you,

Santhosh &amp; Ajitha,

Been some time since I been on,
and had 2 sisters from Ga. to visit this week.
I was having a bad week, but praise God   HE  took care of the situation. When we hit the bottom  you have no place but to reach up to God.
He never fails us. I don't know the answer to your  message, but thank you for your love and prayers.
May  you continue to be a light to others.
God Bless you.

The day was wonderful for us all and I am pasting the notes from everyone in her memory book.

You let the Light of Christ shine so brightly for all to see.  I have read Max's book &quot;Traveling Light'.  He helps us see things in a very special way. I am deep into the study of Isaiah and find it very rewarding and so rich in God's promises!  Also doing an online study of John the Baptist.  That too is very interesting.  Studying Gods Word is a exciting!!  Bless you my dear friend for sharing!!

 Been a lovely day here in sunny FL.
just right.
God bless you  for your spirit God has given you  to inspire others like me too.
We had a ladies meeting   this day and a lunch and a devotion on  Bible verses, each  gives their idea or feeling  on  what the verse is saying to us. you  hear lots of ways God uses us in some special way. Keep your light burning for some lose soul may need it to find the way to Jesus.

We all make those kinds of mistakes.  It serves purpose...even though it's not usual, look over your shoulder for the unexpected!

Time has flown!  My #14 is now over a month, and I'm still knitting on her blanket.  Never have time to sit at home and knit, so it's a slow process as I sit and knit in church on Sunday, or take it with me when we go to a doctor appointment ... It will get done.

We are all down with the flu - type B.  It's no fun, but we will survive it.

I do hope the storms coming this week don't touch you, Carolyn.  We will be getting ice/snow Tuesday/Wednesday, then temps will move up again.  Winter is that way.  I used to love Winter, well I still do, but now I look forward to Spring.  All the vibrant colors returning as new life returns outside.

I do hope all is well with you.  Stay warm and healthy.

love you!</p><span class='guest-user'>Janet Pesklevy  --  <span class='guest-time'>01/30/2011</span></span><p class='guest-content'>Hi Carolyn:
