								<h2>An Unusual Runaway</h2>

								<p>This is the story of the day my Mama ran away from home. Sometimes teenagers run away but surely not mothers!</p>
<p>On this day in the early 1930s there were five of us children, very noisily playing, and sometimes scrapping in selfishness over little things. Lost in doing our own thing, we were oblivious to the fact that Mama was beside herself, trying to get things done, with all the noise and commotion going on. When we finally noticed it, we were shocked at seeing her heading toward the door. Suddenly we were all eyes and ears.</p>
<p>Without any warning, she abruptly told us that she was leaving and never coming back. She had had enough and just couldn’t take it anymore. Dealing with all those rowdy children was getting to her, along with a difficult husband who did not really understand the problems of rising children. He never offered to help but gave her lots of criticism. He blamed her if the kids were noisy. Sometimes he would come home and lie down on the couch for a nap, right in the middle of where we were playing and then demand that she keep us quiet. Has anyone ever seen that many little children playing quietly?</p>
<p>As the door closed behind her, we were stunned and fear began to take hold of us. We realized she was really leaving us, I was only around six or seven years old but I remember it as though it were yesterday.</p>
<p>We stood starring through the window in unbelief as we watched her walk down the street to the place where the bus stopped. We watched with tears as the bus pulled up to the curb and the door opened. I don’t remember much else of what we did at that moment. I just remember that noisy playing became tears of panic.</p>
<p>Times were hard and frustrations were high but this was unthinkable. What would happen to us? We were so frightened. She had finally gotten our attention but it was a little too late. I do not remember where our dad was but he was not there, and the future looked bleak.</p>
<p>God was with us that day, but we didn’t think about that when Mama left. Through our tears, we wondered, “what will we ever do without her? A terrible feeling for little children!</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like if God decided he had had enough of our world today with its attitude of self sufficiency, fun and games, with no regard, respect or time for him? We are all too busy doing our own thing with little thought about our need for Him in our lives. What if He decided to run away and leave the world to shift for itself? He would have the right you know!</p>
<p>Our thoughts about Mama were nothing in comparison to the fearful thought of God leaving this world of rebellious people. If God ran away, all of us would die within a very short time. Think about it. God is light so light would be gone. Everyone would be in panic because no one could see anyone or anything. God is love so there would be none of that here. He is also a God of order and without order in a crowd, there can only be chaos and disaster. Can you even imagine a world with no order, light or love? It would be horror far beyond imagination!</p>
<p>Mothers may feel like running away sometimes but not God. His love far outweighs a mother’s love. John 3:16 proves that. He not only loves us but he has provided a way for us to live with him forever in heaven. To those who are his Children, through Faith in Christ, there is no need to fear. His promise is “I will never leave you nor forsake you. Heb. 13:5</p>
<p>Our tears were turned to joy when suddenly to our surprise, the door opened and there stood Mama. I shall never forget what she said to us through her tears. “Well, if I had a new dress, I really would leave”. She needed an excuse in order to save face. She really did love us, in spite of it all. We got serious that day, at least for a little while.</p>
<p>I wonder what it will take to get folks to stop and listen to God.</p>
<p>Christian love,</p>
<p>Carolyn</p>
