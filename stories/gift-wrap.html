								<h2>Gift Wrap</h2>

								<p>As Christmas day gets closer, the packages begin pile up in all their beautiful wrappings. The  			decorations are in place and parties and meals planned. Wrapping gifts for loved ones is fun and  			after all,love is what Christmas is all about. I count the gifts to make sure no one is forgotten.                         It is a feeling of satisfaction when the job is done. Christmas will be a day to remember.</p>
<p>In my growing up years the memories of Christmas wrappings are many and varied. There was the time  			when a group of college students gave gifts that were beautiful in their simplicity. A group of  			caring young people who wanted to share. They gathered us as underprivileged children together and  			provided each of us with new pajamas and slippers wrapped with special care. Something we had never  			had before. Their caring was the special wrap that I remember best.</p>
<p>Another vivid memory of Christmas wrap was during the days of the great depression. Our hopes at  			Christmas time were always high. We sang in school about how to behave ourselves so that Santa would  			bring us toys and things. Times were hard for families as large as ours. We strung popcorn to  			decorate the tree that came from the woods. We had tinsel but no lights. Still it looked pretty and  			we went to bed with dreams that Santa would bring us some beautifully wrapped gifts.</p>
<p>Even though we very were poor we believed that Santa had plenty of gifts for everyone.  So, very 			early Christmas morning we awoke and jumped out of bed and ran down the stairs to see the treasures. 			In our minds we had visions of fun and laughter as we opened our gifts. When we looked under the  			tree there was absolutely nothing there. No toys, no candy, not anything at all.</p>
<p>Walking back up the stairs was a little slower. Tears were blurring our vision and our hopes were  			shattered. We did not even notice that our parents had done the best they could. There on each  			pillow was a tiny gift. It was not wrapped in fancy paper. It was just a very small toy, an orange  			and two walnuts.  The gift wrap was a tiny stocking.  Christmas is not wrappings it is loving.   			Gifts are a reslult of love wrapped or not.  It is not really the wrapping or the gift it is the  			thought that counts.</p>
<p>As I remember finding the  tree empty of gifts, I wonder  would Jesus would feel if he came to my  			house on Christmas morning only to find my tree laden with gifts for everyone else but on his  			birthday absolutely nothing there for him. If he came to my parties and found that there was no  			place set for him. In all the fun and laughter would he find there were not even any thoughts of  			Him. Sometimes we get so busy we do not have time to think about what Christmas it is really all  			about and the reason why we are doing all this.</p>
<p>The gift of God to us on that first Christmas was not beautifully wrapped in fancy paper. It was  			wrapped in the beauty of love. It was love wrapped in simple fare in a manger in Bethlehem.  The  			love from God was his only son given to pay our sin debt so that we could have the hope of eternal  			life.  How can we give him less than our best?</p>
<p>In all these gifts that required so much time and expense to buy and wrap, have I even had one  			thought about the one whose birthday we are celebrating?   Does he really want a beautifully wrapped  			gift under the tree?  What is the gift he most desires?  God once said,  My son, give me thine  			heart.  No wrapping required.</p>
