								<h2>Toaster Mechanic</h2>

								<p>Cleaning house is a necessary evil and the only thing fun about it is when it is done. It is  			however nice to have things clean and I was reminded of this when I was giving my kitchen a good  			once over. While emptying the bottom flap that opens to let the crumbs out of my toaster, I noticed  			that this was only a small part of the collection of crumbs and burned on grime within. This was  			going to be a complicated job because of the crumb traps that were in there. What could I use to  			enable me to get past the electrical apparatus inside to clean out those hard to reach places? I  			decided to use my ingenuity. No crummy little toaster was going to defeat me.</p>
<p>Wrench in hand and an upside down piece of kitchen apparatus began the battle of wits. I will get  			you clean if it takes all day, was my plan.  I could not really say it was a battle of wits because a  			toaster is an inanimate object and has no say so. However, it was the culprit and I was the master  			there.</p>
<p>I took out all the screws and pulled the doubled sides and top off. Then to my surprise some little  			pieces fell out, but that would be no problem. I would figure out where they went. I washed all the  			non electrical parts but there was still burned on matter that I could not reach. Therefore, I  			decided to soak the electrical part too. It was finally clean and I was so proud of myself. I would  			be sure to let it dry well before I put it back together. No sense getting in a hurry and causing a  			fire. Then came the fun.</p>
<p>I had received a warning from my daughter about fires caused by craziness and meddling with things  			beyond my capability, but I was not worried. I jokingly said, oh well, I need a new house anyway.  			That was good for a laugh but was not really funny. It is not a good idea to experiment with  			danger.</p>
<p>In many ways we experiment with danger every day of our lives. We take chances that keep our guardian 			Angel busy keeping us out of trouble. We are unaware of all the ways we are protected by the grace  			of God everyday. God often has his angels working overtime to compensate for our self proclaimed  			ability. Sometimes God has to smile as he tells an angel to keep a close watch on that person whose  			ego far surpasses his brain capacity. Some things are better left alone as I was about to find  			out.</p>
<p>Light or dark brown, my toaster always did its job faithfully. I have heard this expression many  			times, &#8220;if it is not broke do not fix it. Well, I fixed it alright. It had seemed so simple but now,  			as I looked at all those pieces. I was baffled. It was amazing how much I thought I could remember  			until I actually attempted to complete this impulsive cleaning job. Finding that my ability to  			disassemble far surpassed my capability to reconstruct, the only remedy was to admit failure and  			give all the parts to someone who might be able to restore it to usefulness.</p>
<p>Often in life we forget that Satan loves to turn people&#8217;s lives upside down. Then he will use his  			wrench of temptation along with our own inflated ego to blind us to his deception and the danger of  			doing things that better judgment would leave alone. The results of tampering with sin and an  			attitude of throwing caution to the wind can lead to tragedy.</p>
<p>God has a great and wonderful plan for our lives but when we refuse to follow his leading and allow  			Satan to influence our thinking we are apt to end up like the young man in the story of the lost son  			in Luke 15:11-32. Although he was a good son, he allowed his ego to lead him into the snare of the  			Devil. His desire to live it up resulted in taking him down to the place where his life was a  			disaster. Like the useless pieces of my dismantled toaster his life of sin had brought him to a  			state of hopelessness. He had created his own unsolvable problems, and finally realized that he  			needed help. The beauty of this story is the ending where a loving, forgiving father took his sons  			shattered life and put it back on track.</p>
<p>Repairing a broken life that is caused by sin is not easy unless we are willing to humble ourselves  			before a loving Heavenly Father who can pick up the pieces, wash them clean in the blood of the  			Lamb, and make life whole again. 1 John 1:9 says, If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to  			forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
<p>I had learned a hard lesson. It was not only stupid, but costly. Just one look was all it took for  			the repairman to make a decision. Some morning very soon you might see me walking into a department  			store where I will ask some very profound questions like, Clerk, where are the new toasters located?  			Do you have one without any small parts? Are there any self cleaning ones?</p>
