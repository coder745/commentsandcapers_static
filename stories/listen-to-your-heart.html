								<h2>Listen to Your Heart</h2>

								<p>My heart was talking to me one day, but I was not listening. Sometimes the heart&#8217;s silent words  			speak loudly warning us to pay attention and make adjustments. It is wise to listen and take heed.  			My feelings on this day were not normal but I was not being rational either.</p>
<p>I felt exceptionally tired after having had a very busy and strenuous day. So, having finished my  			chore I decided to lie down on the couch for a nap. As soon as I got comfortable, I began to feel  			strange. It felt as though someone had placed something extremely heavy on my chest. I also heard  			strange sounds like that of hundreds of Katydids filling my ears and hurting my head.</p>
<p>I got up slowly, and made my way to the back door, and looked out to see if I had been invaded by a  			swarm of those shrill green insects.  There was nothing out there. What was happening to me? I felt a  			bit of panic. Surely I was not having a heart attack. That only happens to other people. While  			anxiously walking the floor, fearful of the obvious, I deceived myself into believing it was only  			indigestion.</p>
<p>As a mother of two and a grandmother of five, I had so much to live for and so much love to give.  			This was no time for it to be over. To a grandmother this love is the reverse of having heart  			trouble. It is heart joy beyond measure, and yet at that moment, I began to wonder whether there  			would be any more time to give that love or to enjoy the blessings of all seven of my very special  			gifts from God.</p>
<p>After a few tense moments, the feeling went away but I could still hear those shrill sounds in my  			ears. Finally the sounds stopped, but that night when I laid down to sleep the pain suddenly came  			again though not as severe. I took an acid reflux pill, and the pain went away. I told no one  			except to mention a little chest discomfort that was now gone. I was in denial because I was sure  			it was a false alarm. I was fine the next morning or so I thought.</p>
<p>As I drove past my doctor&#8217;s office on a planned shopping trip, I knew that I should stop and have  			him check this out. However, I had planned to go shopping with my two older grandsons and their mom  			and I did not want to disappoint them or myself. I felt fine all day and said nothing to them about  			the pains. After all, everyone has a little indigestion now and then.</p>
<p>We shopped all day, ate out and had a good time. I was fine until we got back to their house and  			drove into the garage. Suddenly, it became difficult for me to step out of the car. There was no  			denying it this time. Whether in denial or not I had a serious problem.</p>
<p>As I went by ambulance to the hospital, I could not help but think how irrational I had been and how  			good God had been to keep me safe in spite of my being so stupid. Clogged arteries are a serious  			matter, and to ignore the warning signal was very foolish. I could have died.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this time there was a happy ending. They put a stent, a piece of stainless steel, in an  			artery of my heart to keep it open for the blood to flow. I now value every moment of life with  			family and the joy of knowing that God spared me. We need to trust the sounds in our ears and the  			urgings of our heart because the life we save may be our own.</p>
<p>There is wisdom in the statement, &#8220;listen to your heart&#8221;. When speaking of the heart, we can also  			mean our innermost being, the place where God speaks to us. To refuse to listen is being unwilling  			to acknowledge that God could be speaking to us by what we are experiencing. Someone has said that  			if you want to know what God is telling you to do, you should listen to our heart.</p>
<p>God was speaking to me with pain and with warning to do something about it. When he speaks to our  			hearts it is because he wants to guide us in the way we should live. &#8220;Trust in the Lord with all  			your heart and lean not to your own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him and he will  			direct thy path.&#8221; Proverbs 3:5- 6</p>
<p>Pay attention to chest pains and also that quiet voice deep within your innermost being. Listen to  			your heart. It just may be that God is trying to tell you something!</p>
