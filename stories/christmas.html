								<h2>Christmas</h2>

									<h3>What is Christmas all about</h3>
								<p>Joke: Here is a little humor: &#8220;Christmas is the only time we sit in front of a dead tree and eat  			candy out of our sock&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seriously&#8230;Christmas is a celebration of Jesus!  Lets take an in depth look at what Christ&#8217;s birth  			must have meant to the shepherds. In Luke 2:8-9, Here is the story in modern English: &#8220;There were  			sheepherders camping in the neighborhood. They had set night watchers over their sheep. Suddenly  			God&#8217;s angel stood among them and God&#8217;s glory blazed around them. They were terrified!</p>
<p>That is beyond fear&#8230;Sore afraid&#8230; I think they were frozen in place at the sight of this sudden  			and unusual invasion.    I would have had a heart attack. Have you ever been really frightened? Fear  			comes from the unknown when the unexpected happens&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I have ever been terrified- or  			scared stiff. I have felt panic a time or two. I have often been very afraid, but I can&#8217;t imagine  			being terrified.</p>
<p>One night I was home alone when suddenly, I heard the screen door open and then there was a loud  			knock at the door. I peeked out the window and saw three rough looking men standing ready and  			waiting for me to open the door.</p>
<p>My feeling&#8211;I was very much afraid&#8230;.or scared..</p>
<p>Panic was when I grabbed my husband&#8217;s shot gun and nervously tried to put a shell in the chamber   			and it jammed.</p>
<p>Terrified is what I would have been if they had kicked the door open..</p>
<p>Peace was when they gave up and left.</p>
<p>The shepherds were in awe of the calming voice of the Angel when he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid.  I am  			here to announce a great and joyful event. A Savior has just been born in David&#8217;s town. A Savior  			who is Messiah and Master&#8221;.  Hearing this must have had a real stabilizing effect on them. Can you  			even imagine how wonderful and different an angel&#8217;s voice sounds?</p>
<p>They were Shocked at the news. A Savior? -the Messiah?. They had  expected and longed for the  			Messiah for years. Could he really be here?  The angels gave them directions on how to find this  			exciting answer to their life long prayers.  Imagine the surprise when they learned he was in a  			place reserved for cattle.   The Angels said, you will find him if you go and look for him.  This  			is what you are to look for: He will be wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.</p>
<p>Again a sudden happening &#8212;A Thrilling awesome sight. The sky was full of angels giving glory to  			God and proclaiming peace on earth. They heard the Heavenly voices. The Angels recognized the glory  			and majesty of God by giving glory to him in the Highest&#8230;A reference to Heaven where God  			dwells&#8230;Matt. 6:9 And on earth peace. and good will toward men.</p>
<p>Rome had external peace at the time but this was a promise of &#8212; A peace of mind and soul made  			possible by the Savior.</p>
<p>They came running to Bethlehem -searching every stable as they went and finally they came to the  			place where the young child, the Christ Child lay in a manger with his mother and Joseph there  			beside him.   Imagine the thrill as they looked into the face of the one the angels had announced.  			The one who had was to be the savior of the world.  They knew that it was not just a baby it was the  			Lamb of God.</p>
<p>Impressed and convinced. They began to tell everyone they met.  They had found peace and joy such  			as they had not known all their lives.  They knew first hand what many do not know.  The real reason  			for the season we celebrate.</p>
<p>Man today can also find the joy and peace in their heart, mind and soul that God has promised if  			they will only look for him. Only those who know the child of bethelehem, the messiah that the  			angels announced, the savior of the world can ever have a truly MERRY Christmas.</p>
<p>To all who truly know him, I wish you a very Merry Christmas.  God Bless you all.</p>
