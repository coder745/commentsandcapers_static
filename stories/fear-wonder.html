								<h2>Fear &#038; Wonder</h2>

								<p>One summer night back in the nineteen thirties, my sister and I were allowed to have a night out  			at the amusement park in Flint, Michigan. It was extra special to us because times were very hard in  			those depression years. We had a good time and had spent all of our money by closing time, except  			for a dime each for bus fare home.</p>
<p>My sister had met a new guy who asked to drive her home. I was her little sister and of course I was  			not invited. I was to go home on the bus, alone.  I was not afraid even though it was near midnight.  			I could get a transfer and get on another bus that would take me right to the corner, just one house  			away from where we lived.</p>
<p>I boarded the bus and dropped my dime into the slot and asked for a transfer. I was shocked when the  			driver said, &#8220;There are no transfers this late.  We only go downtown and then to the bus barn.&#8221; There  			are no more buses tonight.&#8221; I panicked and asked for my dime back, to no avail.</p>
<p>I left the bus without it in hopes I could catch my sister for a safe ride home. I called out to her  			but she was gone, and I was alone. I began to cry as I continued to call out to her. The park was  			closing and everyone was leaving. I was about three miles from home, and I would have to walk there  			in the dark. I must have been about eleven our twelve years old.</p>
<p>My greatest fear was that the first part of my walk would be a half mile or more of dirt road past a  			place called Dewey woods. I think it was a game preserve because I had seen deer there. There were  			no street lights, and except for the moonlight it would be a very dark and frightening walk.</p>
<p>Fear gripped me and, I must have been crying loudly because suddenly two older boys seemed to appear  			out of nowhere. They must have been in their middle to late teens. They had heard my crying and  			come to see what was wrong. I told them my problem through my tears. They said, &#8220;don&#8217;t cry, little  			girl,we will walk past the woods with you&#8221;. I had never seen them before.</p>
<p>Along with my fear of the woods and the dark, I was also afraid of the boys. As we began the walk,  			I stayed about 10 to 15 feet ahead of them. They walked together behind me just talking to each  			other. They never said another word to me. They followed me until we passed the woods, and came to  			an intersection where there were street lights. Then they turned and went in another direction,  			without a word. I could not see where they went.</p>
<p>I crossed a main avenue and continued my walk/run down the center of the street. All the houses were  			dark because in those days there was nothing to keep people up late. There was no traffic but fear  			kept me from the sidewalk where there were trees and shadows. I ran down the middle of the deserted  			street. I heard somewhere that fear would, &#8220;lend wings to your feet&#8221;. Night, fear, and silence,  			except the sound of my running feet, and my prayers, proved it to be true. The Bible says, &#8220;This  			poor man cried and the Lord heard him &#8230;&#8221;[Psalms 34:6] I believe this works for scared little girls  			too.</p>
<p>At the end of my trip, I would have to pass another dark and woodsy park. My home was just beyond it  			and across one more street. My fear mounted as I got closer. My final run could be a record for  			speed. Home never looked so good.</p>
<p>My sister never would believe that I had walked home. I think her unbelief was for two reasons. She  			did not want it known that she sent me home alone nor that she had gotten into a car with a fellow  			she had just met. This would have been big trouble for her. I never told my parents because when  			little sisters get big sisters in trouble, things can get very unpleasant.</p>
<p>It is kind of like all of us when we sin. We don&#8217;t want it known because our feelings of guilt can  			make us miserable. We resent anyone who points out our faults. We kind of hope that, God will not  			notice. Actually, no one has to tell on us because God already knows. He even knows about the  			thoughts and intentions of our hearts. [Hebrews 4:12]</p>
<p>Today, as I think back, I wonder why this experience of fear has remained so vivid in my memory. I  			have wondered many times who those boys were and where they came from so suddenly. Why were they  			willing to walk with me as my protectors? Why did they turn off when we passed the danger of the  			big woods and then seem to disappear? They had not even asked what my name was nor did they tell me  			theirs. They had to be very special young men or this story could have had a very different ending.  			I still wonder who they were.</p>
<p>Do you believe in Angels? I do without a doubt!</p>
<p>God&#8217;s Word says, &#8220;The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear him and delivers them.&#8221;  			Psalm 34:7</p>
