								<h2>Fellowship Hall</h2>

								<p>Sunday is always a special day of my week.  It is my joy to teach a ladies class in Sunday School.                         This was an ordinary Sunday with the usual routine except  on this day, the ladies gave me a very                         substantial cash gift for my birthday.  I was also invited out to lunch with friends as another                         birthday gift.  I was elated and very thankful as I returned for the afternoon service confident                         that my day was complete.</p>
<p>When the afternoon service was over and we were all ready to go home,  a final announcement by                         the pastor kept us from leaving.  He asked us all to &#8220;step into the fellowship hall  because I have                         something to show you&#8221;.</p>
<p>My thought was that, since the church had recently purchased a new outdoor sign, around which we                         had  gathered for a prayer of dedication after the morning service,  this could be another meeting                         to discuss what to do with the final part of the sign.   It was sitting in the fellowship hall and                         some decisions probably needed to be made.  Since the business of the church is important, I                         casually followed the crowd.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember that there were only a few people around me as I got closer to the door. They                         must have gone another way and got in there ahead of me.  Suddenly someone gave me a little push                         into the room and I was startled when I found myself looking into the faces of my family and friends                         from everywhere.  They were all smiling serenely and triumphantly.  I was totally overwhelmed when I                         realized what was happening. Cameras were flashing but I was so stunned I did not care.</p>
<p>Then came big smiles and giggles from two little toddlers, my youngest grandchildren, who  came                         running excitedly across the room with arms open wide for a hug. Their excited looks revealed their                         pleasure at having slipped in for the celebration without giving away the secret.  It was like I                         was in a dream but as I felt their  hugs I knew that this was really real.  When everyone began to                         sing Happy Birthday there was no denying that a surprise birthday party was underway and I was the                         extremely shocked and speechless guest of honor.</p>
<p>A beautiful corsage was  pinned on me by someone,  Then  another person  presented  me                         with a  bouquet of  a dozen pink roses saying, &#8220;these are for you&#8221;. Then I received                         lots of Smiles and hugs of congratulations and best wishes for having reached this                         milestone in my journey of life.  The Cards and gifts, the beautiful birthday cake and                         especially the expressions of love from so many made this a memory for me that will stay                         in my heart for the rest of my life. In my younger years this special day had seemed like                         a millennium away but now it was actually here.  A day of celebration for the new title                         of Octogenarian.</p>
<p>It is a big name but it took me a lot of years to be able to claim it.  Thank God for                         all his blessings along the way and especially for the  surprise blessings he sends to us even                         when we are not expecting them.</p>
<p>Life is full of surprises and we cannot be sure of what our day will bring to us.  Only                         God knows what the future holds.  He is a loving, faithful, awesome God.  He has blessed my                         life abundantly. Did he know about this party? Yes he did, even before the planners ever                         conceived the idea.  He planned our lives  even before we existed.   He knows all about us                         and loves us anyway.</p>
<p>The love of family and friends is God&#8217;s special gift to us. Material gifts, while loved                         and greatly appreciated are  trivial compared to God&#8217;s gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ.                         Birthdays come and go and we grow older but his love never changes. His mercies are new every                         morning. His amazing grace brought the gift of salvation to me many years ago.  It is still                         available to all who believe.</p>
<p>Should I have another decade or just one more day to live, I want my life to count for Jesus                         until the  day when My Lord will stop time for me and I will hear him say &#8230;&#8221;step into Heaven&#8217;s                         fellowship hall, I have something to show you.&#8221;</p>
