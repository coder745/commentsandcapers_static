								<h2>Got my attention</h2>

								<p>It was an otherwise normal day and things were going along fine until the phone rang, and I heard  			fear and panic in the voice on the other end. When she said, &#8220;The woods are on fire!&#8221;,  I knew there  			was cause for alarm. Now that might not have been quite as frightening to me if it were somewhere  			else, but these woods are right up the hill from my new home. I had just moved in and, this was no  			laughing matter. It got my serious attention.</p>
<p>Someone had been innocently burning trash when the wind suddenly came up and caused the fire to  			get out of control and spread through the grass and into the woods.  This area of woods covers miles  			of tree covered hills and residential areas. This was a very serious situation. When efforts to put  			out the fire seemed futile a frantic call to 911 was made.</p>
<p>As I was hurriedly making my way up the hill toward the fire someone shouted to me to go back  			down toward the highway where I could direct the fire fighters in the direction of the fire. Because  			of its location, the fire might not be seen from the road.</p>
<p>Now, I am a senior citizen, and my legs do not move real fast. It was a very long walk, but I  			found myself motivated by the urgency and made it in record time. Seconds were important, and the  			minutes seemed very long while waiting for the big red truck with the flashing lights to arrive.  			The wind was really blowing, and there was danger of a real catastrophe. Was I praying? You better  			believe it. God does not promise to keep us out of trouble. He does promise to help us when we are  			in trouble.  We were definitely in trouble.</p>
<p>As I had hurried toward the road the fear in my heart for, myself and others who could be hurt by  			this was overwhelming. I heard the siren and took courage, but then it faded out as if it had made a  			wrong turn and might not get here in time. My home and the homes of others were in harms way, and I  			was nervous. I have often advised others to live by Philippians 4:6 where it says &#8220;do not worry  			about anything.&#8221; At this point human nature took over, and I found it difficult to take my own  			advice.</p>
<p>Then I saw something that struck me as very strange and unusual. In a large field right next to  			the driveway where I was standing, there was a herd of cattle. They were usually scattered around  			grazing quietly, but now they were all huddled together in a very close group and seemed extremely  			restless. They kept moving slightly as a group and looking at me. Also, a strange little dog that I  			had never seen before was barking at me from the other side of the driveway. He was acting very  			odd.</p>
<p>Animals can hear sirens long before humans. Perhaps they can also smell the smoke sooner. Fear  			was no doubt in their minds, too. In their own way, they were probably trying to warn me of the  			danger. Sometimes we do not give animals the credit they deserve.</p>
<p>It was a tense time and one of relief when that big red truck came around the curve. To me these  			men coming to the rescue were like &#8220;angels riding in a red chariot&#8221;. They did not have wings, but  			they had water that could save the day, if it was not too late.</p>
<p>When I got back up the hill, I saw something else extremely frightening. The fire had encircled  			a large tree and was rapidly burning upward toward the branches. It was an awesome and terrifying  			sight. I had never seen fire climb like that. If it had reached the branches water would have been  			insufficient, and the fire would have spread out of control. Thank God the water hose was put in  			action, and that tragedy was prevented. The ground fire was another story, but the firefighters  			knew what to do. A great deal of damage was avoided, and I believe that it was God&#8217;s mercy that  			sent help in time.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s promise of grace and mercy are seen in Hebrews 4:16 where he says, &#8220;Let us therefore come  			boldly before the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of  			need.&#8221; It makes good sense to call upon him for help in time of trouble.  &#8220;God is our refuge and  			strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221;. Psalms 46:1.</p>
<p>Water and fire are a blessing from God and a necessity for living. Under control they will serve  			us well. However, out of control, they become our enemies. We need to have a healthy respect for  			them and for the God who created them.</p>
<p>Fire got our attention that day. The degree of our respect for it is at record high.</p>
